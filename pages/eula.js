              This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement
              between you and Quakemap;
            </p>
            <p>
              This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of our
              Quakemap software ("Software") directly from Quakemap or
              indirectly through a Quakemap authorized reseller or distributor
              (a "Reseller").
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the
              installation process and using the Quakemap software. It provides
              a license to use the Quakemap software and contains warranty
              information and liability disclaimers.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you register for a free trial of the Quakemap software, this
              EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking "accept"
              or installing and/or using the Quakemap software, you are
              confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become
              bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a
              company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
              authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms
              and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not
              agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not
              install or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA
              agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by
              Quakemap herewith regardless of whether other software is referred
              to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Quakemap
              updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support
              services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those
              items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.

            </ul>
            <h2>Intellectual Property and Ownership</h2>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>

              granted by this EULA agreement will immediately terminate and you
              agree to stop all access and use of the Software. The provisions
